<p>Amazing/interesting things I’ve done.&nbsp;Learning/lessons</p>
<p>Projects I worked on&nbsp;recently.</p>
<h1 id="startup-city-guides">Startup City&nbsp;guides</h1>
<p>I maintain simple city guides for the startup communities in Montreal, Berlin, <span class="caps">NYC</span>, and a few other lovely places. While quite basic, these resources websites receive lots of love from entrepreneurs and investors worldwide. Sometimes all we really need is a simple page summarizing the key&nbsp;information.</p>
<h1 id="commuting-carpooling">Commuting <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Carpooling</h1>
<p>The first company I started was ambitious. It helped commuters connect and carpool with people sharing a similar itinerary. We polished our products and communications for 3 years. We worked with employers and municipalities, as well as marketing directly to car owners. We grew a local following but it proven to be a incredibly hard market to monetize. Tackling the complex and severe traffic problem has been a unmatched learning&nbsp;opportunity.</p>
<h1 id="designing-for-photographers">Designing for&nbsp;photographers</h1>
<p>It is a lot of fun to work with a passionate photography community. After 4 years of rapid growth, the 500px team streamlined its product design and revisited some of the critical touch points with its users. User research helped us better position 500px’s product and we dramatically optimized engagement rates through simple metric-driven experiments.
Beside staring at amazing photos all day long, I also helped 500px successfully launch a revamped homepage and on-boarding&nbsp;process.</p>
<h1 id="foray-into-the-newsroom">Foray into the&nbsp;newsroom</h1>
<p>It’s not everyday that a traditional news organization invest $10M on a new experimental product.
Working on the launch the Toronto Star new tablet-based daily has been, so far, the crazyest project I have worked on.
In a five months timespan, I hired and lead a new creative departement of 20. We made sure the company had all the proper tools and processes in places. That involved educating the sales team on relevant interactive advertising as well as writing <span class="caps">UX</span> guidelines for the&nbsp;newsroom.  </p>
<h1 id="-end">——————-&nbsp;end</h1>
<p>Beside leading the product design, I worked closely with the company executives to ensure a smooth&nbsp;launch.</p>
<p>This included working closely with another newspaper, working&nbsp;on  </p>
<p>Building the team, ux of the product, processes, went from 0 to 20 employees in 4 months. Complete with training, new space, furniture and software. Never seen a project scaled up that fast. Entire new team, in parallel of other&nbsp;ops.</p>
<p>refine the product positioning and improve engagement.
I mainly helped revamp the home page and the onboarding process, as well as work on the information&nbsp;hierarchy</p>
<p>as advise the design team on a number of side products.  products positioning.  initiated lots of user research and&nbsp;revamped</p>
<p>the mid-size startup finally had the time to streamlines its products. , the company had reached an interesting&nbsp;stage</p>
<p>500px is one of the biggest online community for photographers. I had an amazing time there helping the design team streamline the user experience. We identified and optimized&nbsp;various  </p>

I had the chance to combine my hobby some of my best time at work working with 500px (photo-sharing&nbsp;startup).</p>

<h2 id="500px">500px</h2>
<p>In 2010 I started to work&nbsp;on</p>
<p> weroll.net postmortem: make things open source (mention spaghettiness). Team page. Challenges and failures. Honest observation. Mention uber might one day take over this segment, in a more intrusive and less communal way, but that I would love to work on other transport related problem or give another shot at the same highly problematic state of transportation in cities. Out of the things that didn’t work, that’s the one I’m the most proud. Mix of algorithmic and tegh problem (open sourced), messaging, legal and business (who pays in the end). It was all around a hard project. We kept trying and evaluating new approaches, but after 2 years we realized how carpooling is still a radical idea today and we didn’t how long it would take to finally become more common. By fighting hard problems, It teached us perseverance. I truly wish cities, governements, and drivers will eventually make more edfort to facilitate&nbsp;carsharing.</p>

<p>About page: only place I should “sell” my work. Project page should remain focussed on the work, inyeresting for industry people, not just clients. Builds notoriety. Highlight challenges and funny&nbsp;bits!</p>
<p>Make projects pages more articles than bland description. Find a problematic and answer it in the post. Ex:
weroll. the unglamourous innovation of ridesharing to work. the massive impacts of ridesharing to work: uber offers modern cab experience and taps into a vast network of part-time drivers(we know that). Electric car doesn’t solve trafic problem, the massive cost of car ownership, and will likely remain inaccesible to developing countries where transportation offer is less diversified.
For 3 years I built a platform, a team, and a company to tackle this problem.
Platform: matching people who shares similar commute and schedules was the necessary starting point. Basic geolocation and maths and took care of finding the best fits. There’s a myth that such programs require a huge criical mass to take off. Even in areas of low adoption, most users were able to find passengers on their way to&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>Promoting the unglamourous
This is the area where our small team worked the hardest. It’s really not easy to get drivers on board! Everyone agrees it’s a great idea, but we changing behaviour is another&nbsp;story.</p>
<p>Making it a company - scaling things up
We targeted individuals who needed transport alternatives and also explored working with employers and cities (both benefits a lot from higher carpooling rates).
We largely underestimated ideological resistance, and it was an uphill battle but we saw slow and steady progress.
Stoping it was hard: sunk cost fallacy: we had invested so much, we would lose all that work. But the ressources were allready gone.  If we stop now, it’ll have been for nothing…
The investment i made was the reason i kept carrying on. Needless to say it’s no the right one. Contradiction of carrying on, then stopping a project.
It was the rational&nbsp;decision.</p>
<p>The reasonable solution would have been to wait until the market (consciences?) evolves. But it was my first company and I was too eager to scale down operations and wait for  opportunities to unfold.
We were all getting exhausted from working so hard on various fronts, so at one point we just decided to move on while the company didn’t have any&nbsp;debts.</p>
<p>I keep being impressed with all the transportation innovation, we live in a really exciting time and I look forward to see all the creatives ways cities will evolve to accommodate the shifting&nbsp;demographics.</p>
<p>from over while we were working so&nbsp;hard.</p>
<p> to work still sounds radical to most people.  simply not&nbsp;ready</p>
<p>Being a product person, it was likely the part I enjoyed the&nbsp;most.</p>
<p>challenges, story of the&nbsp;cie.</p>
